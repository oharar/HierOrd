# HierOrd

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of HierOrd is to provide code to fit hierarchical ordination models. At the moment it does not work, which is why ther eis not installation instruction.

HierInla.R has the workflow that will eventually be wrapped into a function. There are a few functions that will become internal functions once it is working.

## Installation

You can install the development version of HierOrd like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(HierOrd)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
