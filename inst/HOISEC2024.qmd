# What is Model Based Ordination?

## The Data

Communities: $S$ species at $N$ sites

Data, $Y_{is}$ are a $N \times S$ matrix. 

- Assume from the exponential family 
    - normal, Poisson, binomial etc.

## The Model

$$
g(E(Y_{is})) = \eta_{ij} = \alpha_i + \beta_{is} + \sum_{l=1}^L \gamma_{il} z_{jl}
$$ 

$\sum_{l=1}^L รง z_{jl}$ means $Cov(\eta_{is}, \eta_{it}) = \sum_{l=1}^L z^2_{sl}

# Concurrent Ordination

What if we model the site effects, $\gamma_{il}$?

$$
\gamma_{il} = X \beta + \epsilon_{il}
$$

Without $\epsilon_{il}$ this is the same as a constrained ordination

REFERENCE

# Hierarchical Ordination

If we can model $\gamma_{il}$, why not also model $z_{sl}$?

$$
z_{sl} = Z + \varepsilon
$$

Trait effects, phylogeny etc etc

## What does this mean?



# Fitting a Hierarchical Ordination

Difficult!

- MCMC (incl. HMC) seems to do poorly.

So, let's try something different

## Spot the GLM

If we condition on $z_{jl}$, this is a GLM

$$
g(E(Y_{is})) = \eta_{ij} = \alpha_i + \beta_{is} + \sum_{l=1}^L \gamma_{il} z_{jl}
$$

If we condition on $\gamma_{il}$, this is a GLM

$$
g(E(Y_{is})) = \eta_{ij} = \alpha_i + \beta_{is} + \sum_{l=1}^L \gamma_{il} z_{jl}
$$

So why not draw $z_{jl}$ or $\gamma_{il}$ from their distribution, and marginalise?


## In details

Draw $z_{jl}$

Fit $g(E(Y_{is})) = \eta_{ij} = \alpha_i + \beta_{is} + \sum_{l=1}^L \gamma_{il} z_{jl}$

Simulate $\gamma_{il}$ from its posterior

Fit $g(E(Y_{is})) = \eta_{ij} = \alpha_i + \beta_{is} + \sum_{l=1}^L \gamma_{il} z_{jl}$

Simulate $z_{jl}$ from its posterior

etc.

## In details

This is just a Gibbs sampler, but multivariate

We can marginaise over the posteriors, not just draw from them.

# Examples

One Latent Variable

# Improvements

Identifiability (can we just rotate at the start?)

Space, time, phylogeny
